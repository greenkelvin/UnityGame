# Overview

This is a Unity game that I created to learn the Unity editor and the C# programming language. The game is a 3D platforming game in which you guide 
your player from one tower to another. Most of the code I wrote will be under /Assets/Scripts/. The scripts are what controls the player and camera
and allows for input from the user. Also control moving objects in the game.
